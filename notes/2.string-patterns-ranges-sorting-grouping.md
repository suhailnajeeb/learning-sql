# String Patterns

## Matching string:

```sql
select book_id, title from book
    where book_id = 'B1';
```

## Looking for String Patterns:

Display all authors with firstname starting with R  
**Predicate:** Like  
**Wildcard:** %

```sql
select firstname from author
    where firstname like 'R%';
```

# Ranges:

## Without Range:

```sql
select title, pages from book
    where pages >= 290 and pages <= 300;
```

## Retrieving values using Range:

```sql
select title, pages from book
    where pages between 290 and 300;
```
# Sets

## Without set of values:
```sql
select firstname, lastname, country from author
    where country = 'AU' or country = 'BR';
```

## Retrieving rows using a set of values:
```sql
select firstname, lastname, country from author
    where country in ('AU', 'BR');
```

# Sorting Result Sets:

## Order by title (Ascending Order):

```sql
select title from book
    order by title;
```

## Order by title (Descending Order):

```sql
select title from book
    order by title desc;
```

## Order by specifying the column number:

```sql
select title, pages from book
    order by 2;
```

# Distinct Clause: 

## Eliminating duplicates:

List the unique countries:

```sql
select distinct(country) from author
```

# Count:

Counting the number of countries:

```sql
select country, count(country) from author
    group by country
```

Counting the number of countries and giving the count column a name: 

```sql
select country, count(country) as count
    from author
    group by country
```

# Having Clause:

Restricting the result set using **having** clause.

```sql
select country, count(country) as count
    from author
    group by country
    having count(country) > 4
```
