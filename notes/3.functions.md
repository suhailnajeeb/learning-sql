# Functions in SQL:

- Built-in Functions
- User Defined Functions

# Aggregate or Column Functions

## Sum Function: 

Add up all values in a column

## Syntax:

```sql
SUM(COLUMN_NAME)
```

## Examples:

Add all values in the SALEPRICE column

```sql
select SUM(SALEPRICE) from PETSALE
```
Explicitly name the output column SUM_OF_SALEPRICE

```sql
select SUM(SALEPRICE) as SUM_OF_SALEPRICE
    from PETSALE
```

# MIN, MAX, AVG

## Min: Returns the minimum value

```sql
select MIN(ID) from PETSALE where ANIMAL = 'Dog'
```

## Max: Returns the maximum value

```sql
select MAX(QUANTITY) from PETSALE
```

## Average: Return the average value

```sql
select AVG(SALEPRICE) from PETSALE
```

Mathematical operations can be performed between columns

```sql
select AVG(SALEPRICE / QUANTITY) from PETSALE
    where ANIMAL = 'Dog'
```

# Scaler and String Functions

## ROUND()

Round up or down every value in saleprice:

```sql
select ROUND(SALEPRICE) from PETSALE
```
Retrieve the length of each value in ANIMAL:

## LENGTH()

```sql
select LENGTH(ANIMAL) from PETSALE
```

## UCASE

Retrieve ANIMAL values in Uppercase:

```sql
select UCASE(ANIMAL) from PETSALE
```

## DCASE

```sql
select * from PETSALE
    where LCASE(ANIMAL) = 'cat'
```
select distinct values:

```sql
select DISTINCT(UCASE(ANIMAL)) from PETSALE
```

# Date, Time Functions

## Examples:

Extract the DAY portion from a date:

```sql
select DAY(SALEDATE) from PETSALE
    where ANIMAL = 'Cat'
```

Get the number of sales during the month of May:

```sql
select COUNT(*) from PETSALE
    where MONTH(SALEDATE) = '05'
```

## Date/Time Arithmetic:

What date is it 3 days after each sale date? 

```sql
select (SALEDATE + 3 DAYS) from PETSALE
```
Special Registers:

```sql
CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME
```
Find how many days have passed since each SALEDATE till now:

```sql
select (CURRENT_DATE - SALEDATE) from PETSALE
```
