# SQL Fundamentals

While recently learning the basics of SQL, I created a bunch of notes and sql codes for reference. You will find that these notes are parallel to the following online courses:

- [SQL and Relational Databases 101](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/learn-sql-relational-databases)
- [Databases and SQL for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-data-science)

The course on [cognitiveclass.ai](https://cognitiveclass.ai) is free and  you could follow the materials if you want. The SQL for Data Science course is part of Coursera's
[IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) Program and provides a brief introduction to SQL for data science.

This repository contains some basic sql code and notes. The notes aren't really descriptive if that is something you are looking for. Its mostly a collection of some basic syntaxes with some examples.

You can find some of the notes in my blog:
